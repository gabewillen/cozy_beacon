NRF51822 firmware for a custom temperature sensor used on my properitary HVAC zoning system "Cozy" that I designed for my two story house. Each room can be individually controlled using inflatable dampeners inside the duct.
The system monitors static pressure and supply temperature to prevent excessive strain on the Blower.
